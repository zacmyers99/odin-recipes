    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This is a recipe about <strong>chocolate chip cookies</strong>. My grandmother used to make
        chocolate chip cookies. She died last year, but that's okay. We don't mind.
        Today we're going to make chocolate chip cookies with chocolate chips, sugar,
        and flour.
    </p>

    <p>BChocolate chip cookies have always been one of my favorite dishes. Making chocolate
        chip cookies can be time-consuming, but the results are <em>well</em> worth
        the wait.
