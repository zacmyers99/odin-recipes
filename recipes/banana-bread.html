    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This is a recipe about <strong>banana bread</strong>. My grandmother used to make
        banana bread. She died last year, but that's okay. We don't mind.
        Today we're going to make banana bread with bananas, sugar and flour.
    </p>

    <p>Banana bread has always been one of my favorite dishes. Making banana bread
        can be time-consuming, but the results are <em>well</em> worth the wait.
